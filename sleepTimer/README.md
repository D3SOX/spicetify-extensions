# sleepTimer.js

![Example](example.png)
*This script pauses playback after a certain amount of time.*
*It is a faithful recreation of the feature from mobile Spotify*

### Installation
1. Install [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app) and set it up according to the instructions.
2. Navigate to your Spicetify config directory via the command `spicetify config-dir`.
3. Download sleepTimer.js and place it in `/extensions`.
4. Run `spicetify config extensions sleepTimer.js` and `Spicetify apply` in terminal.

### Usage
Click on the stopwatch icon on the playbar to open the selection menu, then select what time you want the music to stop after.

### Compatibility
This extensions code is pretty bad, there might be a lot of small bugs but the base functionality *should* stay consistent and unbreaking.
