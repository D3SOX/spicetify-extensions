*This script provides a context menu option in Spotify's desktop app that allows you to view a scannable code for any uri.*

### Installation
1. Install [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app) and set it up according to the instructions.
2. Navigate to your Spicetify config directory via the command `spicetify config-dir`.
3. Download scannables.js and place it in `/extensions`.
4. Run `spicetify config extensions scannables.js` and `spicetify apply` in terminal.

### Usage
Right-click on any object that contains a uri, you should see a submenu called "Show Spotify Code".
Click on the option to view, click outside the shown image to exit.

### Compatibility
