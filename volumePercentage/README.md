![Example](example.png)
*This script shows your volume in a percentage value when hovering or changing it.*

### Installation
1. Install [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app) and set it up according to the instructions.
2. Navigate to your Spicetify config directory via the command `spicetify config-dir`.
3. Download volumePercentage.js and place it in `/extensions`.
4. Run `spicetify config extensions volumePercentage.js` and `Spicetify apply` in terminal.

### Usage
Hover over your volume bar to see current percentage, change volume and watch it update in real time.

### Compatibility
This extension has almost no chance of breaking, it relies on one mostly unchanging Spotify platform API and the css map being up to date.
